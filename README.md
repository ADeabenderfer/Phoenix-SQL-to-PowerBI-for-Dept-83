# Phoenix-SQL-to-PowerBI-for-Dept-83
Queue work stored in SQL displayed in PowerBI Reporting

Existing Phoenix in-program data availability/issue:
- Limited to past 90 days
- Only available in Excel format
- Processing time to pull data and format into manager presentation: apprx 30 mins
- Additional data required contacting the Phoenix Product owner for SQL coding/report
-     Took time and effort away from their primary duties and not feasible on a regular basis.

Actions taken:
- Obtained access and Learned SQL via online tutorials
- Created code to pull all data from when the dept began using Phoenix
- Set up in PowerBI with auto-refresh for Dynamic manager review. 

Note: This was created within the last 30 days of employment in this job role. 
Due to this, I was not able to improve the code or reporting views further.
